# TextSummarizationUsingTF
Text summarization using only term frequency (TF) is a simple and basic approach that relies on counting the occurrences of each word in a document (input text) and using those counts to create a summary. The TF method does not consider the context or semantics of the words; it only considers their frequency of occurrence in the document.
